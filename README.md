Data manipulation tools for python.

This is a collection of various submodules and useful functions
for manipulating some (what I've found to be) common data
structures in python.

Outline
======

*  ddict : dotted-dictionary class and operations
*  grouping : data grouping routines
*  mongo : pymongo-related functions
*  np : numpy-related functions
*  qfilter : list-of-dicts filtering with a mongo query syntax
*  listify : make something a list (if it isn't already)
*  plot : matplotlib-related functions
*  rmap : data remapping
